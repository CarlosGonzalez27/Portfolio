            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at the University of California Irvine looking for computer software opportunities. I was drawn to computer science and engineering because of the creative brainstorming that is required when tackling challenging projects. I've always enjoyed the ability to create interesting things through my programming background. My hobbies include exploring new places and cultures. </p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Through my time as a Computer Science and Engineering student I have learned to use many computer languages which range from assembly in x86 and MIPS to higher level languages like Java and C++. My program of study has given me a sturdy foundation in computer languages that is further complemented by knowledge in the hardware systems that are used to implement them. </p>
